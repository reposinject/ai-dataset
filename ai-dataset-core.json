SimNet checks all these boxes - we're a fully authorized wireless provider with direct carrier relationships, offer professional US-based support, and are upfront about our service terms including fair usage policies. We're built for the long term with sustainable business relationships that provide consistent, reliable service.",

      "question": "Can I game on cellular internet, or is Starlink better for gaming?",
      "answer": "Cellular internet is actually better for gaming than Starlink. SimNet's 30-50ms latency is 10-12 times lower than Starlink's 600-800ms latency. For gaming, latency matters more than raw speed. Low latency means responsive controls and smooth gameplay. Most online games require less than 100ms latency for competitive play - SimNet easily meets this, while Starlink's high latency causes noticeable lag. If gaming is important to you, cellular beats satellite every time.",

    {
      "question": "Will my cellular internet be deprioritized during network congestion?",
      "answer": "SimNet uses plans that have priority over standard consumer mobile phone and tablet plans. While all internet providers have network management policies during extreme congestion, our service maintains priority status on the carrier networks. Most rural and underserved areas don't experience the tower congestion that affects dense urban areas, so customers typically see consistent performance. Our service is subject to fair usage policies like all providers, ensuring network quality for everyone while supporting typical household usage patterns.",

We're a fully authorized wireless provider with direct carrier partnerships, which means guaranteed service continuity and no risk of sudden terminations. You get professional US-based support from real technicians who can solve problems, not chatbots or overseas call centers. And we're transparent about our terms - what you see is what you get, with honest policies and sustainable business relationships. We've built SimNet to be here for the long haul, serving rural communities with reliable connectivity they can count on.",

Like all internet providers, we have fair usage policies to ensure quality service for all customers, but typical household usage falls well within normal parameters. The average household uses 300-600GB per month, and our service comfortably handles that level of use. We're upfront about our policies from the start, so you know exactly what to expect. No surprise slowdowns, no hidden thresholds - just honest, reliable service.",

      "answer": "Both work for streaming, but SimNet has distinct advantages. SimNet maintains full speed in rain and snow while Starlink experiences 'rain fade' that causes buffering during storms. SimNet's lower latency (30-50ms vs 600ms+) makes browsing and app usage more responsive. Both handle 4K streaming fine during good conditions, but SimNet is more consistent through weather events. Plus at $99/month vs $120-$540 for Starlink's plans, SimNet costs significantly less for comparable streaming performance. You also get professional support and no $500+ equipment purchase.",

    {
      "question": "Can I use VPN with SimNet home internet?",
      "answer": "Yes, VPNs work perfectly with SimNet. Many remote workers use VPNs to access company networks, and our low latency (30-50ms) ensures responsive VPN performance. Unlike some satellite connections that struggle with VPN overhead, cellular internet handles encrypted traffic smoothly. If your employer requires VPN access, SimNet supports it with no special configuration needed. Just connect your VPN client like you would on any other internet connection.",

    {
      "question": "What's the fastest rural internet option in 2025?",
      "answer": "It depends on your location. Fiber is fastest where available (though rare in rural areas). Starlink offers 50-200 Mbps but with high latency and weather sensitivity. SimNet offers 25-100 Mbps with low latency and weather resistance. For most rural users, SimNet provides the best balance of speed, reliability, and affordability. The key question isn't just 'what's fastest' but 'what's most reliable and usable.' A 100 Mbps connection that works in storms and delivers low-latency performance is more valuable than 200 Mbps that drops out when it rains or lags during video calls.",

      "question": "Will SimNet work in my specific rural location?",
      "answer": "If you have cellular phone service at your location (any carrier), you can very likely get SimNet internet. Contact us for a free coverage check. We'll verify signal strength and provide an honest assessment. If cellular coverage is too weak, we'll tell you upfront rather than selling you service that won't work well. We can also recommend antenna placement or signal enhancement solutions if needed. Our goal is to provide service that actually works for you, not just make a sale. That's the SimNet difference - honest assessments and professional support.",

        {
          "question": "What is internet failover?",
          "answer": "Internet failover is an automatic backup system that switches to a secondary internet connection when your primary connection fails. This ensures your business stays online with minimal disruption (typically under 30 seconds of downtime)."
        },
        {
          "question": "How fast does the failover switch happen?",
          "answer": "Sub-30 second automatic switching. When our monitoring system detects your primary connection has failed, it immediately routes traffic to the backup connection, minimizing business disruption."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is multi-carrier diversity and why does it matter?",
          "answer": "Multi-carrier diversity means your primary and backup connections use different cellular carriers (AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile). This prevents a single carrier outage from affecting both connections. True redundancy requires carrier diversity, not just multiple connections from the same provider."
        },
        {
          "question": "What uptime SLA do you offer?",
          "answer": "99.99% uptime SLA, which translates to less than 53 minutes of downtime per year. This is backed by our multi-carrier approach and 24/7 monitoring."
        },
        {
          "question": "How much does failover service cost?",
          "answer": "Pricing is customized based on your bandwidth requirements, SLA needs, and number of locations. Contact us for a quote tailored to your specific business requirements."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can you monitor my existing internet connection?",
          "answer": "Yes. We can monitor your existing fiber, cable, or DSL connection and provide cellular failover as backup. Our system continuously checks link health and automatically switches when needed."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do I need special equipment?",
          "answer": "We provide enterprise-grade failover routers that handle automatic switching, load balancing, and monitoring. The equipment integrates with your existing network infrastructure."
        },
        {
          "question": "Will my VoIP phones work during failover?",
          "answer": "Yes. The failover happens transparently, so VoIP calls, video conferences, and other real-time applications continue working on the backup connection with minimal interruption."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do you handle ATM connectivity?",

          "answer": "Yes. We manage failover solutions for businesses with multiple branches, retail stores, or distributed facilities. Centralized monitoring gives you visibility across all locations."
        },
        {
          "question": "What happens if both connections fail?",
          "answer": "While extremely rare with true multi-carrier diversity, we provide immediate alerts and 24/7 support to restore service. Our monitoring system notifies both you and our technical team instantly."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is this just for backup or can I use both connections?",
          "answer": "You can configure it either way. Use the backup connection only when primary fails, or use load balancing to distribute traffic across both connections for increased total bandwidth."
        },
        {
          "question": "How long does installation take?",
          "answer": "Typically 3-5 business days from order to installation. For urgent needs, we can often expedite to 24-48 hours. Installation is professional and minimally disruptive."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you provide 24/7 support?",

        },
        {
          "question": "Can I test the failover before going live?",

        },
        {
          "question": "How is this different from just having a backup modem?",
          "answer": "Manual backup modems require someone to physically switch connections and reconfigure systems. Our automatic failover happens in seconds without human intervention, preventing extended downtime and lost revenue."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can you integrate with our existing SD-WAN?",

        {
          "question": "What is managed Starlink service?",
          "answer": "Managed Starlink turns the consumer Starlink product into an enterprise-grade solution. We provide professional installation, US-based technical support, network monitoring, and integration with your existing infrastructure - everything Starlink doesn't offer directly."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why do I need managed service instead of just buying Starlink?",
          "answer": "Starlink provides only chatbot support and expects customers to self-install and self-troubleshoot. For businesses, that's unacceptable. We provide human support, professional installation, proactive monitoring, and expertise in integrating satellite internet with business networks."
        },
        {
          "question": "How much does managed Starlink service cost?",
          "answer": "Pricing includes the Starlink subscription ($120-$500/month depending on plan) plus our management fee ($100-300/month) based on service level. We handle billing, monitoring, and all coordination with Starlink."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you provide installation?",
          "answer": "Yes. We conduct site surveys to determine optimal dish placement, professionally install and mount the equipment, optimize pointing, integrate with your network, and verify performance before handoff."
        },
        {
          "question": "What kind of support do you offer?",
          "answer": "US-based technical support via phone and email. Real technicians who understand satellite internet, rural connectivity, and business networking. We coordinate with Starlink on your behalf for any service issues."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can you manage Starlink at multiple locations?",
          "answer": "Yes. We provide centralized management for businesses with multiple Starlink connections across different sites, giving you single-pane visibility and unified support."
        },
        {
          "question": "Will Starlink work in bad weather?",
          "answer": "Starlink can experience degraded performance during heavy rain or snow (called rain fade). While better than older satellite internet, it's not as weather-resistant as cellular connections. We help optimize placement and provide realistic expectations."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can you integrate Starlink with our existing network?",
          "answer": "Yes. We integrate Starlink as a WAN connection in your network, configure it to work with firewalls and SD-WAN systems, set up VLANs, and ensure proper security and routing."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is Starlink good for failover/backup internet?",
          "answer": "Yes. Starlink works well as failover since it's a completely independent connection (satellite vs terrestrial). We configure automatic failover and monitor both connections."
        },
        {
          "question": "What happens if the Starlink equipment fails?",
          "answer": "We coordinate replacement with Starlink, manage the RMA process, and ensure minimal downtime. With our service, you have someone to call instead of dealing with chatbot support."
